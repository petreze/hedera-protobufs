### TransactionRecordEntry
As transactions are handled and records and receipts are created, they are stored in state for a
configured time period (for example, 3 minutes). During this time, any client can query the node
and get the record or receipt for the transaction. The `TransactionRecordEntry` is the object
stored in state with this information.
